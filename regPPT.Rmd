Treat this as abstract. Write from proposal what we basically do in this project   
test

# The Ozone Dataset    

## Data description  

### about the data  

# Explorartory Analysis  

###The summary statistics , model plots and scatterplot matrix

# Multicollinearity
We deal with this first
